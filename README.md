1. [Manga eden api docs](https://www.mangaeden.com/api/)
2. [Waffle board](https://waffle.io/thestuckster/KabbaManga)

Installation
=============
Clone the repo and run
`npm install -g ionic cordova ` to install ionic as well as cordova and their dependencies. This may take some time. 
`npm install` to install the dependencies needed for the project
and 
`bower install` to install the web dependencies needed for the project 

Development
===============
To start the live reload dev page run: `ionic serve` within the apps folders.

>- **Note:** The main page of the app is still the init code from Ionic. To see the current iteration of the list of manga navigate to `/app/mangaList` either by typing it in the url or typing ` g #/app/mangaList` while serving.

Ionic View
==============
Have a change you want to see on your phone? Download the Ionic View app from the app/play store. Make sure to make an ionic account also. Then navigate to the project and run `ionic upload` and follow the prompts. It should appear in the app to download and view in a few minutes.  

Task Board
=================
Please assign yourself to any task you feel like working, wither it is in the TODO coloumn or not. Once it is moved to the In Progress lane please do not update the task unless you have important information regarding it or you have talked to whoever is currently working on it. 

Anything in the //TODO takes priority over the things in the backlog. If there is something in the backlog you feel should be done first go ahead and move it into the TODO and change its milestone version to match the others in the coloumn. 

Each task has an associated weight (the number on the ticket). This is a representation of how hard/important the task may be. If you feel the weight should be higher or lower please change it. 

Adding tasks: if there is anything you feel should be added to the board at any time please do so. If you do not know what weight or milestone will best fit it you can leave it blank and update it at a later time. 

>- Note: Once the tasks in the Done lane add up to be >= 100 they will be archived and thus removed from the board. This will help keep the board organized and easily managed.
